# Quest notes

planner: perf-critical kernels -- assess a mechanical HIP port vs an AMD-native (rocWMMA/CK/MFMA) rewrite of the hot kernels; a correctness-first port is a valid first step.

## Porting attempt 2026-06-04

### Scope
Stage 1 only: `rms_norm.cu` and `topk.cu`. The flashinfer-dependent attention kernels (Stage 2) use NVIDIA-specific PTX intrinsics (mma.sync, ldmatrix, cp.async) that require an AMD-native rewrite.

### Build environment
- ROCm 7.2.1, PyTorch 2.13.0a0+gitb5e90ff (development build)
- a ported raft (no longer tracked here) built and installed at `_deps/raft/install`)

### Issues encountered

1. **PyTorch TensorImpl.h C++20 concepts incompatibility**: The PyTorch headers use `requires` clauses that fail to parse with the HIP compiler unless `-std=gnu++20` is used. Worked around by setting `CMAKE_HIP_STANDARD 20`.

2. **Multi-arch flags from Torch CMake**: `find_package(Torch)` adds `--offload-arch=gfx90a;gfx942;gfx950;gfx1100` from the PyTorch build. Worked around by setting `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx90a` environment variable.

3. **__HIP_NO_HALF_CONVERSIONS__ breaks static_cast<float>(__half)**: PyTorch ROCm sets this flag to disable implicit half conversions. The `rms_norm.cu` kernel uses `static_cast<float>(h->x)` which fails. Required explicit `__half2float()` calls.

4. **Name collision with PyTorch symbols**: A `half_to_float` macro clashed with `at::attr::half_to_float` in PyTorch's interned_strings.h. Renamed to `quest_h2f`.

5. **raft radix_topk_one_block_kernel overload resolution**: The raft kernel function pointer capture fails with "incompatible initializer of type '<overloaded function type>'". This is a blocking issue in how Quest's `decode_select_k.cuh` captures the raft kernel.

### Blocking issue
The raft select_k integration needs investigation. The Quest code captures a function pointer to raft's templated kernel but the HIP compiler cannot resolve the overload. This may require changes to how Quest calls raft's select_k API.

### Files modified (uncommitted, on moat-port branch)
- `quest/ops/CMakeLists.txt`: USE_HIP option, HIP language enable, raft via find_package
- `quest/ops/cmake/hip_build.cmake`: HIP-specific build config (unused, early return approach)
- `quest/ops/csrc/rms_norm.cu`: wave64 warp-size abstraction, half<->float conversion traits
- `quest/ops/csrc/bsk_ops.h`: USE_HIP guards for flashinfer-dependent declarations
- `quest/ops/csrc/bsk_ops.cu`: USE_HIP guards for pybind module
- `quest/ops/csrc/pytorch_extension_utils.h`: USE_HIP guard for DISPATCH macro
- `kernels/include/topk/decode_select_k.cuh`: HIP runtime aliases

## 2026-08-06 dependency

`depends_on: [raft]` cleared. raft is no longer a MOAT project (the ROCm-DS team owns
the RAPIDS domain), so it is an ordinary external build dependency here rather than
something this pipeline builds first. If the build needs it, install it from the
environment like any other third-party library.
